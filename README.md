# Off-axis projection in Unity

A bare-minimum example project for getting off-axis projection up and running in Unity.

This work is based on the article found [here](https://medium.com/@michel.brisis/off-axis-projection-in-unity-1572d826541e?source=friends_link&sk=1884d03651947a41cd553168714cbfb6).

The application can be executed as follows:

- Run 'off-axis-projection.exe', which requires 'UnityPlayer.dll' and the folder 'off-axis-projection_Data'.
- Press 'S' or 'Enter' in the application
- From console, access the Python-tracking directory >> cd C:\<path>\off-axis-projection-unity-master\Python-tracking
- Run >>python main.py

The application should begin showing the off-axis perspective as in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11oc2YuKHkMvqdLqCBxBuSGJyH_6QfDcP/view?usp=sharing).

For exiting the applications just press Esc.
